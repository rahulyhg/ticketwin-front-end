<h3 dir="ltr" >4. PAYMENT METHODS.</h3>

<h4 dir="ltr" >4.1 Overview.</h4>

<p>There are two types of payment processing options Organizers may elect when using the Services: (1) "Facilitated Payment Processing" or "FPP", which consists of collecting Event Registration Fees using FPMs; and (2) "Ticket Win Payment Processing" or "CCP", which requires the use of the Gateway for the collection of Event Registration Fees. Depending on the payment processing option the Organizer elects when using the Services, monetary payments will be made to the Organizer directly by Buyers (via FPP) or by Ticket Win (via CCP), in each case as described below.</p>

<h4 dir="ltr" >4.2 Facilitated Payment Processing.</h4>

<h5 dir="ltr" >(a) Independent Relationship.</h5>

<p>When using a FPM, Organizers and Buyers effect the applicable monetary payment transaction through the FPM service and are bound by the applicable terms of use governing the FPM service.</p>

<h5 dir="ltr" >(b) Services Fees.</h5>

<p>Organizers will collect all monies directly from Buyers under the FPP option. By registering for and using the FPP option, you agree to (i) pay Ticket Win all then-applicable Ticket Win Service Fees and Ticket Win Payment Processing Fees, which are based on the number of tickets sold by you and/or the value of such tickets, and which charges are described in greater detail at www.tcktwn.com/fees, and all additional on-site service fees, equipment lease charges, printed ticket fees, and any other fees and charges of any kind payable by you to Ticket Win in connection with the provision of the Services (collectively, "Service Fees"), which payments shall be due and payable upon receipt of the invoice setting forth such charges; and (ii) accept the responsibility for providing refunds to Buyers at your own discretion. Ticket Win will not be responsible or liable for, and Organizer hereby agrees to fully indemnify Ticket Win and its affiliates for, refunds, errors in issuing refunds, or lack of refunds in connection with the use of the FPP option. Invoices are sent monthly for Service Fees incurred in the previous month.</p>

<h4 dir="ltr" >4.3 Ticket Win Payment Processing.</h4>

<h5 dir="ltr" >(a) Gateway; Payment Process.</h5>

<p>When an Organizer elects to use the Gateway for the collection of Event Registration Fees, payment processing occurs directly through Ticket Win. Under the CCP option, Ticket Win will collect all Event Registration Fees on behalf of the Organizer from Buyers and deduct all applicable Services Fees from the Event Registration Fees collected by Ticket Win, and then pass the remainder along to the Organizer within five (5) business days after the event end date for the event to which the Event Registration Fees correspond (either by mailing a check or through an electronic funds transfer, depending on the option the Organizer has chosen through using the Site, to the address or account, respectively, that the Organizer accurately designates on the Site), provided that Ticket Win reserves the right to withhold funds (i) at any time as Ticket Win determines to be necessary for the processing and settlement of all refunds, disputed charges, chargebacks, customer complaints, allegations of fraud, and other discrepancies and (ii) as otherwise permitted pursuant to this TOS. Ticket Win, in its sole discretion, may determine to advance a portion of Event Registration Fees to Organizer prior to the period set forth above, on such terms and conditions as Ticket Win may establish from time to time. Organizer agrees that all Event Registration Fees for a given event are earned by Organizer only following conclusion of the applicable event and all Event Registration Fees ultimately due will be net of all Service Fees, refunds, disputed charges, chargebacks and other deductions, whether due to customer complaints, allegations of fraud, discrepancies related to the applicable event or otherwise. No payments shall be made to an Organizer from Ticket Win with respect to any event that is cancelled. If payments have already been made by Ticket Win to an Organizer for a cancelled event, such Organizer will immediately refund to Ticket Win all such payments upon cancellation of such event. All sales, fees, charges, and funds are payable in U.S. Dollars, or other foreign currencies accepted by Ticket Win. If Organizer elects to list Event Registration Fees in a foreign currency accepted by Ticket Win, Ticket Win will collect and disperse the funds in the foreign currency selected by Organizer.</p>

<p>ORGANIZER AGREES THAT ANY PAYMENT BY Ticket Win OF EVENT REGISTRATION FEES PRIOR TO THE FIFTH (5TH) BUSINESS DAY AFTER THE END DATE OF THE APPLICABLE EVENT ARE MERELY ADVANCES OF AMOUNTS THAT MAY BECOME DUE TO ORGANIZER UNDER THIS TOS AND THAT Ticket Win MAY DEMAND SUCH ADVANCES BACK (FROM TIME TO TIME IN ITS SOLE DISCRETION), AND ORGANIZER SHALL THEREUPON PROMPTLY (AND IN ANY CASE WITHIN FIVE (5) BUSINESS DAYS AFTER SUCH DEMAND) PAY BACK TO Ticket Win SUCH ADVANCE OR ANY PORTION THEREOF DEMANDED BY Ticket Win.</p>

<h5 dir="ltr" >(b) Refunds.</h5>

<p>(i) Under the CCP option, it is the responsibility of the Organizer to communicate its refund policy to Buyers and to issue refunds to Buyers via the Site. An Organizer shall ensure that its refund policy is consistent with the terms of this TOS and the payment and refund mechanics of the Site. The Site permits an Organizer to issue refunds to Buyers, provided the refund is issued by Organizer before ninety-six (96) hours after the end date of an event and within six (6) months after the transaction date for the underlying ticket purchase. Refunds issued following such period will not be processed through the Site, unless otherwise agreed to by Ticket Win in its sole discretion. Subject to the foregoing, refunds issued by an Organizer will be processed within thirty (30) days after Organizer instructs the issuance of the refunds via the Site. All communications or disputes regarding refunds are between the Organizer and Buyer, and Ticket Win will not be responsible or liable for, and Organizer hereby agrees to fully indemnify Ticket Win and its affiliates for, refunds, errors in issuing refunds, or lack of refunds in connection with the use of the CCP option. (ii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, you acknowledge and agree that Ticket Win shall have the right to force a refund of any or all tickets at any time for any reason or no reason, including without limitation if Ticket Win receives complaints from a substantial number (as determined by Ticket Win in its sole discretion) of Buyers with respect to the applicable event or another event held by Organizer, or Ticket Win determines in its sole discretion that Organizer has engaged in any fraudulent activity or made any misrepresentations. Further, if one or more Buyer(s) request a refund, whether due to a cancelled event or for any other reason where Ticket Win would reasonably expect to lose a chargeback, Ticket Win may, in its sole discretion, issue such refund to such Buyer(s), and Organizer shall then owe the amount of such refund to Ticket Win.</p>

<h5 dir="ltr" >(c) Credit Card Chargebacks.</h5>

<p>Under the CCP option, any credit card chargebacks initiated by a Buyer for any reason with respect to an event shall be charged back to the Organizer of such event. All communications and disputes regarding chargebacks are between the Organizer and Buyer, and Ticket Win will not be responsible or liable in any way for, and Organizer hereby agrees to fully indemnify Ticket Win and its affiliates for, chargebacks issued in the course of the use of the CCP option.</p>

<h5 dir="ltr" >(d) No Third Party Beneficiary Rights.</h5>

<p>Organizer is not a direct party to any agreement with any Payment Processing Partner or Card Scheme used to process payments in CCP nor is Organizer a third party beneficiary of any such agreement.</p>

<h4 dir="ltr" >4.4 Non-Exclusive Remedies.</h4>

<h5 dir="ltr" >(a) Payment.</h5>

<p>In the event that Organizer fails to pay to Ticket Win any amount owed pursuant to this TOS when due, such amount shall bear interest calculated from the date due until paid in full at a rate equal to the lesser of (a) ten percent (10%) per annum, and (b) the maximum amount permitted by applicable law. In the event any amounts are owed by Organizer to Ticket Win under this TOS or otherwise, Ticket Win may, without limiting its other rights and remedies, (i) deduct such amounts from Organizer's outstanding balance, whether for that particular event or for any other event that Organizer lists through the Services; and/or (ii) send an invoice to Organizer for such amounts to the extent Organizer's outstanding balance is insufficient to cover these costs, in which case Organizer shall pay Ticket Win such invoiced amounts within thirty (30) days after the date of the invoice. If payment for any amounts due to Ticket Win hereunder are not made by Organizer when due, Ticket Win reserves the right, in its sole discretion and without limiting its other rights and remedies, to terminate Organizer's registration for the Services (including any and all accounts that Organizer may have) and to cancel all other events listed by Organizer.</p>

<h5 dir="ltr" >(b) Confirmation.</h5>

<p>Upon receipt of a credit card authorization from each individual ticket purchase, Ticket Win generates a confirmation message and issues a unique confirmation number. You agree to unconditionally accept, honor, and fulfill all ticketing commitments that have been confirmed by Ticket Win through the Services, and it is your responsibility to verify the Buyer's membership status, confirmation number and/or any event restrictions prior to the subject event.</p>

<h5 dir="ltr" >(c) Taxes; Withholding.</h5>

<p>(i) You are solely responsible for determining which, if any, sales, use, amusement, value added, consumption, excise and other taxes, duties, levies and charges (collectively, "Taxes") apply to your use of the Services and you agree that it is your sole responsibility to, and that you will, collect, remit and report the correct amounts of all such Taxes to the applicable governmental authorities, even if Ticket Win provides you with tax tools or tax calculators that assist you in doing so. Ticket Win does not represent, warrant or guarantee that any tax tools or tax calculators provided to you will meet all tax requirements that may be applicable to you or that such tax tools or tax calculators will result in your collection or remittance of all applicable Taxes, which Taxes may vary based on the nature of your event, the nature of your tax status (individual, entity, business, consumer, etc.), your location, the location of your Attendees, credits and deductions for which you may qualify and other factors, and you hereby release Ticket Win of any and all liability with respect to your use of the tax tools and/or tax calculators. None of such tax tools or tax calculators should be considered legal or tax advice. If you do collect Taxes on the Services, those Taxes will be treated like Event Registration Fees and Ticket Win will pay such amounts to you at the same time as the underlying Event Registration Fees. If you use any tax tools or tax calculators that require you to input a tax registration number, you represent and warrant that such tax registration number is true and correct. Ticket Win cannot give you legal or tax advice, so please be sure to check with your own tax advisor about any applicable Taxes. In the event that a governmental authority requires Ticket Win to pay any Taxes attributable to your use of the Services, you agree to promptly and fully reimburse Ticket Win for such Taxes upon demand and all costs, penalties, interest and expenses related thereto.</p>

<p>(ii) All Fees charged by Ticket Win do not include any Taxes except to the extent that a Tax is expressly set forth in the applicable invoice or billing statement, and you agree to pay any Taxes that are imposed and payable on such Fees (other than those calculated based on Ticket Win's net income) to Ticket Win. If you are outside of the United States, you may be required to self-assess certain indirect Taxes on our Fees (or certain portions of our Fees) under the applicable reverse charge procedure on your indirect tax returns. To the extent you are required to self-assess, Ticket Win will use reasonable efforts to note that on your invoices.</p>

<p>(iii) In addition, due to IRS regulations, if Ticket Win processes transactions and issues you payouts (A) for more than twenty thousand dollars ($20,000) in gross sales; and (B) for more than two hundred (200) transaction orders, in each case during a given calendar year and in the aggregate across all of your accounts, Ticket Win is required to report to the IRS (i) the gross amount of transactions for which you have been paid in that calendar year and in each month of that calendar year; (ii) your name; (iii) your address; and (iv) your Tax Identification Number ("Your Tax Information"). As part of these IRS regulations, Ticket Win is required to either (A) collect Your Tax Information; or (B) establish that you are a foreign person not subject to US taxes, before your accounts pass the two hundred (200) order transaction threshold in the aggregate. Once your accounts cross the two hundred (200) order transaction threshold, you agree that you will not receive any further payments from Ticket Win until either (A) or (B) above are satisfied. To learn more about these IRS regulations and why we are required to do this, see our 1099-K FAQhttp://help.tcktwn.com/customer/en_us/portal/articles/647317</p>

<p>(iv) Ticket Win reserves the right to withhold the payment of any amounts owed to you hereunder if Ticket Win believes in its discretion that it is required to do so by applicable local, state, provincial, national or other law, rule, regulation, judgment or order.</p>
